fio (3.32-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since fio 3.32-2 there is an extra package for the example job files
  for flexible I/O tester. These example job files are not installed by
  default anymore due to the size added by the fiograph images.

  Those images visualize what the examples are doing. So it is easier to
  understand what jobs are running in parallel for example. Read commit
  log from upstream commit d61215e076fe3b51c0ed92dd985101b84bbcd757 by
  Erwan Velu for details.

  If you like to install the examples, just install the package
  "fio-examples".
