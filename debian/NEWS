fio (3.32-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since fio 3.32-2 the collection of example files is provided by the
  "fio-examples" package, which is not installed by default. If you
  like to make use of the examples, install the package "fio-examples".

  Next to the example files you can find images, which visualize what
  the examples are doing. For more details please take a look at the
  commit message for commit d61215e076fe3b51c0ed92dd985101b84bbcd757.
