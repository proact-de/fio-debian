fio (3.36-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since fio 3.35-3 the graphical frontend gfio is no longer being build
  by this package. It is unlikely to be ported to GTK-3 or later and
  GTK-2 will no longer be included in Debian 13 aka trixie. For some use
  cases the application kdiskmark can be a suitable alternative. It is
  available in the package kdiskmark.

fio (3.32-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since fio 3.32-2 the collection of example files is provided by the
  "fio-examples" package, which is not installed by default. If you
  like to make use of the examples, install the package "fio-examples".

  Next to the example files you can find images, which visualize what
  the examples are doing. For more details please take a look at the
  commit message for commit d61215e076fe3b51c0ed92dd985101b84bbcd757.
